Genetic Algorithm for Feature Selection in Lower Limb Pattern Recognition
Motor intent recognition using electromyography (EMG) has the potential to create intuitive control of prosthetic devices. However, EMG signals are noisy in nature, which makes it challenging to extract user intent (Phinyomark and Scheme, 2018). To solve this challenge, feature extraction can be used to improve information density and reduce noise, which leads to better intent recognition. Numerous feature extraction methods and feature combinations have been proposed (Phinyomark and Scheme, 2018; Hudgins et al., 1993; Phinyomark et al., 2017; Phinyomark et al., 2018). The best combination of features can be found by trying out every combination; but with the increase in possible features over the years, this becomes unfeasible. Therefore, feature selection and dimension reduction techniques have been used to remove redundant and irrelevant features.
